Run script/fileupload_server.pl to test the application.

If you want to play with the JavaScript

script/fileupload_server.pl -r &  

cd JavaScriptSrc

npm install

npm start  <-- runs the WebPack development server

# Once your changes are in place you can run
npm run dist

# this last step will copy your javascript files to the Catalyst app "root" directory

- forgot to mention one thing.  If you are tring to play with the javascript you MUST change

axios.post('/upload', data )

to

axios.post('/api/upload', data )

In the file:  JavaScript/src/components/Main.js

This is because Catalyst is listening on port: 3000 and the JavaScript test server is listening on port: 8000

Make sure you change it back before runing "npm run dist"
